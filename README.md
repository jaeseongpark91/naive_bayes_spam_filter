## Naive_bayes_spam_filter

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. This method to classify documents, based on the words that appear within them. A common application for this type of software is in email spam filters. In this project, we will build a spam filter utilizing Naive Bayes algorithm.  

Please refer to the notebook **'spam_filter.ipynb'**.
